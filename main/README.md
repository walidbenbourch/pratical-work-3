## Desription

This is the 3rd pratical work.

A remake of the 1st pratical work made with **HTML** and styled this time with **CSS**.

## It features

1. **Professor Name Hyperlink :** Clicking a professor's name takes you to a new page where you can contact them by filling out a form (you can also find their email).

2. **Course Hyperlink :** Clicking a course opens a new page containing the course's chapters, along with a Google Drive link to the corresponding PDF

3. **Directed/Practical Work Hyperlink :** The same concept as "Number 2"

**Same thing with this pratical work, it has no back-end**
